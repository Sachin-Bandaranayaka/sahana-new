# Critical Fixes Applied - Financial Organization App

**Date:** January 2025  
**Version:** Post-Security Update

---

## ‚úÖ FIXES APPLIED

### 1. **Password Security - CRITICAL** ‚úì
**Issue:** Passwords were stored in plain text in the database.

**Fix Applied:**
- ‚úÖ Installed `bcrypt` package for secure password hashing
- ‚úÖ Updated user authentication to hash passwords with bcrypt (10 salt rounds)
- ‚úÖ Modified `verify-user` handler to compare hashed passwords
- ‚úÖ Modified `changePassword` handler to hash new passwords
- ‚úÖ Updated default admin user creation to use hashed password
- ‚úÖ Added password removal from API responses (security best practice)

**Files Modified:**
- `financial-org-app/client/electron.js`
- `financial-org-app/client/package.json` (added bcrypt dependency)

**Impact:**
- All new passwords will be securely hashed
- Existing users will need to have their passwords reset or migrated
- Database is now secure against password theft

---

### 2. **Foreign Key Constraints** ‚úì
**Issue:** SQLite foreign key constraints were not enabled, allowing data inconsistencies.

**Fix Applied:**
- ‚úÖ Added `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` during database initialization
- ‚úÖ Foreign keys are now enforced for all table relationships

**Files Modified:**
- `financial-org-app/client/electron.js` (lines 30-37)

**Impact:**
- Database integrity is now enforced
- Orphaned records (e.g., loans without members) cannot be created
- Cascading deletes will work properly

---

### 3. **Missing Promise Wrapper in changePassword** ‚úì
**Issue:** The changePassword handler referenced `resolve` and `reject` without wrapping them in a Promise.

**Fix Applied:**
- ‚úÖ Properly wrapped handler logic in `return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`
- ‚úÖ Integrated bcrypt password verification and hashing
- ‚úÖ Added proper error handling for bcrypt operations

**Files Modified:**
- `financial-org-app/client/electron.js` (lines 636-687)

---

### 4. **Entry Point Clarification** ‚úì
**Issue:** Two different main process files exist with different database schemas.

**Resolution:**
- The app actually uses `financial-org-app/client/electron.js` (specified in client/package.json)
- The root `main.js` is NOT used and contains outdated/different code
- All fixes have been applied to the correct file (`client/electron.js`)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT MIGRATION NOTES

### Existing User Accounts
**CRITICAL:** If you have existing users in your database, their passwords are still in plain text!

**You MUST do ONE of the following:**

#### Option A: Reset All Passwords (Recommended)
1. Delete all existing users from the database (except keep the admin with its new hashed password)
2. Have users create new accounts with the updated system
3. The default admin account now has a hashed password for 'admin123'

#### Option B: Migrate Existing Passwords (Advanced)
Create and run a migration script to hash existing plain text passwords:

```javascript
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const sqlite3 = require('sqlite3').verbose();
const path = require('path');

// Get the database path
const dbPath = path.join(require('electron').app.getPath('userData'), 'sahana.db');
const db = new sqlite3.Database(dbPath);

db.all('SELECT id, password FROM users', async (err, users) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error fetching users:', err);
    return;
  }
  
  for (const user of users) {
    // Only hash if not already hashed (bcrypt hashes start with $2)
    if (!user.password.startsWith('$2')) {
      const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(user.password, 10);
      db.run('UPDATE users SET password = ? WHERE id = ?', [hashedPassword, user.id], (err) => {
        if (err) {
          console.error(`Error updating user ${user.id}:`, err);
        } else {
          console.log(`Migrated password for user ${user.id}`);
        }
      });
    }
  }
});
```

## üîç REMAINING ISSUES (Not Fixed Yet)

### High Priority

1. **Date Comparison Issues**
   - SQLite stores dates as TEXT
   - String comparisons like `WHERE date >= ?` may not work correctly
   - **Recommendation:** Ensure dates are stored in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) consistently

2. **Missing Database Columns**
   - Some queries reference `created_date` column that doesn't exist in `organization_accounts`
   - **Location:** Various queries in main.js (not active file, but should be noted)

3. **Input Validation**
   - No validation for email format, phone numbers, or monetary amounts
   - **Recommendation:** Add validation before database insertion

### Medium Priority

4. **Unused Files**
   - `financial-org-app/main.js` is not used but contains different code
   - `financial-org-app/preload.js` (root) vs `client/preload.js`
   - **Recommendation:** Delete unused files or clearly mark them as deprecated

5. **Error Handling Inconsistency**
   - Mix of callback and async/await patterns
   - Some errors are logged but not properly handled
   - **Recommendation:** Standardize on async/await throughout

6. **SQL Injection Risk in Dynamic Queries**
   - Some queries build SQL strings instead of using parameterized queries
   - **Recommendation:** Always use parameterized queries

### Low Priority

7. **Dependencies Cleanup**
   - Multiple SQLite libraries installed (`sqlite3`, `better-sqlite3`, `sqlite`)
   - Only `sqlite3` is actually used
   - **Recommendation:** Remove unused dependencies

8. **Hard-coded Default Password**
   - Default admin password is still 'admin123'
   - **Recommendation:** Force password change on first login

## üéØ TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS

Before deploying to production:

1. **Test Authentication**
   - ‚úì Create new user and verify login works
   - ‚úì Test password change functionality
   - ‚úì Verify old passwords are not accepted

2. **Test Foreign Keys**
   - ‚úì Try to delete a member with existing loans (should fail or cascade)
   - ‚úì Try to create a loan for non-existent member (should fail)

3. **Test Existing Data**
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è If you have existing data, TEST THOROUGHLY before going live
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Make a backup before applying these changes

4. **Security Audit**
   - ‚úì Verify passwords are hashed in database (check with DB browser)
   - ‚úì Test that password is not returned in API responses
   - ‚úì Verify default admin password works and prompt user to change it
