║                   BACKUP & RESTORE - FIXED! ✅                  ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

🐛 THE PROBLEM:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   Backup worked ✓ - Created JSON files with ALL data
   Restore BROKEN ✗ - Only restored members table!
   
   Result: Restore would DELETE everything, only put back members!
   All loans, transactions, cashbook, etc. would be LOST!


✅ THE FIX:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   ✓ Now restores ALL 9 tables completely
   ✓ Proper async/await (operations complete before commit)
   ✓ Foreign keys respected (correct deletion/insertion order)
   ✓ Passwords preserved (your hashed passwords stay safe)
   ✓ Transaction integrity (all-or-nothing restore)
   ✓ Error handling (rollback on failure)


📋 WHAT'S RESTORED NOW:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   ✅ Members
   ✅ Loans & Loan Payments
   ✅ Cashbook Entries
   ✅ Bank Accounts & Transactions
   ✅ Dividends & Dividend Payments
   ✅ Settings (except passwords - security!)


🎯 HOW TO TEST:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   1. Create a backup with some test data
   2. Add new data after backup
   3. Restore the backup
   4. Verify ALL data is restored correctly
   5. Check that your password still works


⚠️  IMPORTANT WARNINGS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   🚨 Restore DELETES ALL CURRENT DATA before restoring!
   
   Always:
   • Create a backup BEFORE restoring
   • Verify the backup file is correct
   • Keep multiple backup versions
   • Test on a copy first if dealing with real data
